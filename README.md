## Project Features

- Adaptable Layout: The page adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes, ensuring a responsive design for all devices.
- Smooth Hover Transitions: Buttons on the page feature smooth hover transitions to improve user interaction.
- Custom Fonts with Fallbacks: Custom fonts are used for a distinctive look, with fallback fonts in place to ensure readability if the custom fonts fail to load.
- Modular CSS: The CSS is broken down into blocks for better organization and maintainability, making it easier to modify specific sections without affecting the entire layout.
- Centered Content: Content is always centered, regardless of the viewport width.
- Overflow Control: The overflow property is used to ensure text remains contained within its respective elements, preventing overflow into adjacent containers.
